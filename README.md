Analyzing Beatles Lyrics: A Journey Through Their Musical Evolution
This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify Beatles’ songs into career phases (early, middle, late). We experimented with TF-IDF, engineered features, and transformer-based models (BERT) to capture thematic and stylistic changes. Results show that BERT outperformed traditional methods, achieving 82.8% accuracy, highlighting the power of contextual embeddings in cultural and artistic text analysis.
